## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant information from an external source (like a document or a database) and uses it to generate more accurate and context-specific answers. This approach is particularly useful for tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge, such as interacting with PDFs to extract precise data and insights.
